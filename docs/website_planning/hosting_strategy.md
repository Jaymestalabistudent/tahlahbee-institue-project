### Overview of Repository and Hosting Strategy

For this project, we have adopted a strategic approach to hosting and deployment to ensure robustness and flexibility. The repository for the front-end will be made publicly available on GitHub, while the back-end will be hosted separately on Render. This separation allows each component to function independently and enhances the overall resilience of the application.

#### Front-End: Static HTML Website Hosted on GitHub
The front-end of our application consists of a static HTML website, designed with a minimal amount of JavaScript and styled using Bootstrap. The source code for this front-end will be hosted in a GitHub repository. This choice offers several benefits:

- Version Control and Collaboration: GitHub's version control system enables efficient management of changes and supports collaborative development. Contributors can easily track updates and participate in the development process.
- Public Accessibility: By hosting the front-end code on GitHub, we provide transparency and allow the community to view, fork, and contribute to the project, fostering an open development environment.
- Efficient Deployment: GitHub Pages provides a straightforward mechanism for deploying static websites, facilitating easy and quick updates without additional infrastructure.

#### Back-End: Hosted on Render
The back-end of the application, responsible for handling server-side logic and data management, will be hosted on Render. Render offers numerous advantages for back-end hosting:

- Scalability: Renderâ€™s infrastructure supports automatic scaling, which allows the back-end to handle increased load and traffic seamlessly.
- Continuous Deployment: Render integrates well with modern CI/CD workflows, enabling automatic deployment of updates and ensuring that the back-end remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
- Security and Reliability: Render provides built-in security features, including SSL certificates and automated backups, which enhance the protection and reliability of the back-end services.

By separating the front-end and back-end hosting, we ensure that each component can operate independently. If there are issues with one part of the system, the other can continue functioning normally, thereby maintaining overall system stability.

#### Integration and Member Access
Although the front-end and back-end are hosted separately, they are integrated to provide a seamless user experience. A "Members" link on the front-end site directs users to a minor front-end interface embedded within the back-end application. This integration ensures that users can access member-specific features and content without disrupting the primary website functionality.

### Conclusion: Independent and Resilient System Architecture
The decision to host the front-end on GitHub and the back-end on Render allows us to leverage the strengths of both platforms. This approach ensures that the front-end and back-end can function independently, enhancing the resilience of the application. If one component encounters issues, the other remains operational, thus providing a more stable and reliable user experience. This separation also facilitates streamlined development and deployment processes, making it easier to manage and update each part of the system.
