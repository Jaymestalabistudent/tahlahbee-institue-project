### Future Plans for the Front-End Development

As we continue to develop and enhance the front-end of our application, we have several exciting plans to expand its functionality and improve the user experience. Our goal is to create a more comprehensive, accessible, and optimized website that meets the needs of our users while maintaining high performance across all devices.

#### New Pages and Content Additions

1. Sales Page: We plan to introduce a dedicated Sales page that will showcase our products and services, including special offers, discounts, and promotions. This page will be designed to drive conversions and provide users with an engaging shopping experience.

2. Counseling Page: A Counseling page will be added to provide users with resources and information related to counseling services. This page will feature detailed content, including descriptions of available services, booking options, and contact information for support.

3. Educational Page: To support our users with valuable knowledge and resources, we will create an Educational page. This page will host articles, tutorials, and other educational materials relevant to our field, helping users gain insights and learn more about the topics they care about.

#### Enhancements and Optimizations

1. Additional Social Media Links: We will expand the social media presence on the website by adding more social media links. This will help users connect with us on a wider range of platforms and stay updated with our latest news and offerings.

2. Accessibility Improvements: To ensure our website is accessible to all users, we will introduce more alt text for images and improve keyboard navigation. These enhancements will make the site more inclusive, providing a better experience for users with disabilities.

3. Responsive Design Tweaks: We will focus on improving the user interface on smaller devices by optimizing views and ensuring that content is easy to navigate and read on mobile phones and tablets. This will include making adjustments to layouts, font sizes, and interactive elements.

4. Optimizations for Low-End Devices: To improve performance on low-end devices, we plan to remove non-essential features such as Lottie animations on these devices. This will help reduce load times and improve the overall experience for users with limited hardware capabilities.

5. CSS Minimization: We will work on minimizing the CSS used throughout the site to reduce file sizes and improve load times. This optimization will make the website faster and more efficient, contributing to a smoother user experience.

6. Repackaging with Vercel, Vite, or Webpack: To enhance the development process and deployment capabilities, we plan to repackage the front-end using modern build tools like Vite or Webpack. Additionally, we may deploy the site using Vercel to take advantage of its serverless functions and fast global content delivery.

7. Content Management System (CMS) Integration: A CMS page will be added to allow for easier content updates and management. This integration will enable us to quickly and efficiently update the websiteâ€™s content without needing to make code changes, thereby improving our agility in maintaining the site.

### Conclusion: A Roadmap to an Enhanced Front-End

These future plans reflect our commitment to continuous improvement and user satisfaction. By adding new pages, improving accessibility, optimizing performance, and integrating modern tools, we aim to create a more robust, user-friendly, and versatile website. These enhancements will ensure that the front-end remains engaging and functional, providing users with an excellent experience, regardless of their device or connection quality.
