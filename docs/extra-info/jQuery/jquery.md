# Installing jQuery via CDN (Content Delivery Network)

jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. One of the easiest ways to include jQuery in your web project is through a CDN. Follow the steps below to install jQuery using a CDN:

## Step 1: Choose a CDN provider

There are several CDN providers that host jQuery files. Some popular ones include:
- [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries)
- [Microsoft Ajax CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/ajax/cdn/overview)
- [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery)

For this tutorial, we'll use the Google Hosted Libraries CDN.

## Step 2: Select jQuery version

Decide which version of jQuery you want to use. You can choose from the latest version or specify a specific version depending on your project requirements. 

## Step 3: Include jQuery in your HTML file

Add the following line inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML file to include jQuery using the Google Hosted Libraries CDN:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
