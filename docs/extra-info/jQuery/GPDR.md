# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Personal Data

#### Definition of Personal Data

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 'personal data' is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, known as the 'data subject'. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, particularly by reference to an identifier. These identifiers can include, but are not limited to:

- **Name**: A person's full name or surname.
- **Identification Number**: National identification numbers, social security numbers, or any unique identifier assigned to an individual.
- **Location Data**: Data that indicates the geographical position of a person, such as GPS coordinates.
- **Online Identifier**: Digital identifiers such as IP addresses, cookies, or device identifiers.
- **Physical Identity**: Characteristics such as height, weight, or other physical attributes.
- **Physiological Identity**: Information related to the body's functions and processes.
- **Genetic Identity**: Data derived from DNA or other genetic material.
- **Mental Identity**: Information about a person's mental health or psychological state.
- **Economic Identity**: Financial information, employment details, or economic status.
- **Cultural Identity**: Data related to cultural practices, language, or heritage.
- **Social Identity**: Information about social relationships, affiliations, or social status.

#### Identifiability

A person is considered identifiable if they can be recognized, directly or indirectly, through any of the aforementioned identifiers. This identifiability can occur through the combination of various pieces of information that, when put together, can uniquely identify an individual.

#### IP Addresses and Personal Data

The classification of IP addresses as personal data under GDPR can be nuanced and context-dependent. Generally, IP addresses can be considered personal data if they can be used to identify an individual, either directly or indirectly. This identification can occur through:

- **Direct Identification**: When an IP address is linked to a specific individual, such as in the case of static IP addresses assigned to a particular user.
- **Indirect Identification**: When an IP address, in combination with other data, can lead to the identification of an individual. For example, dynamic IP addresses, when combined with timestamps and other data, can potentially identify a user.

However, there are circumstances where IP addresses may not be considered personal data. For instance:

- **Anonymization**: If IP addresses are anonymized in such a way that the individual cannot be identified by any means reasonably likely to be used, they may not be considered personal data.
- **Aggregation**: When IP addresses are aggregated and used for statistical purposes without the possibility of identifying individuals.

#### Conclusion

In summary, under GDPR, personal data encompasses a wide range of information that can identify an individual. While IP addresses can be considered personal data, their classification depends on the context and the ability to link them to an identifiable person. Organizations must carefully assess their data processing activities to ensure compliance with GDPR, particularly in how they handle and protect personal data, including IP addresses.
