In this tutorial, I will cover the process of loading, creating, and building a database in Flask using SQLAlchemy manually as sometime common errors crop up. I will also address some common errors that you may encounter during this process.

## Step 1: Loading the Database

To load the database in Flask, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules: Import `Flask` and `SQLAlchemy` in your Flask application module.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
```

2. Create the Flask application instance: Create an instance of the Flask application.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. Configure the database URI: Set the URI for your database. For example, if you are using SQLite, you can set the URI as follows:

```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
```

4. Initialize the SQLAlchemy object: Initialize the SQLAlchemy object and bind it to your Flask application.

```python
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

## Step 2: Creating the Database Models

To create the database models, follow these steps:

1. Define the models: Define your database models as classes, inheriting from the `db.Model` class.

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(60), nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User('{self.username}', '{self.email}')"
```

2. Add relationships between models: If you have relationships between models, define them using the appropriate SQLAlchemy relationship fields.

```python
class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    user = db.relationship('User', backref=db.backref('posts', lazy=True))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Post('{self.title}')"
```

3. Create the database tables: After defining your models, you need to create the database tables. To do this, run the following command:

```python
db.create_all()
```

## Step 3: Building the Database

To build the database, follow these steps:

1. Import the models: Import the models you defined in your Flask application module.

```python
from your_flask_app import User, Post
```

2. Create the Flask application instance: Create an instance of the Flask application.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

3. Initialize the SQLAlchemy object: Initialize the SQLAlchemy object and bind it to your Flask application.

```python
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

4. Create the database tables: After importing the models and initializing the SQLAlchemy object, you can create the database tables using the `db.create_all()` method.

```python
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

During the process of loading, creating, and building a database in Flask, you may encounter some common errors. Here are a few examples and their solutions:

1. **ImportError: No module named 'flask'**: This error occurs when the Flask module is not installed. To fix this, make sure you have Flask installed by running `pip install flask` in your terminal.

2. **OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table**: This error occurs when you try to access a table that does not exist in the database. Make sure you have created the necessary tables using the `db.create_all()` method.

3. **ProgrammingError: (sqlite3.ProgrammingError) SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread**: This error occurs when you try to access the database from multiple threads. To fix this, make sure you are using the Flask application context when accessing the database.

### Overcoming Errors

During the process of loading, creating, and building the database, I encountered a few errors. Here's how I overcame them:

1. **ImportError: No module named 'flask'**: I realized that I hadn't installed the Flask module. To fix this, I ran `pip install flask` in my terminal to install Flask.

2. **OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table**: I realized that I hadn't created the necessary tables in the database. I added the `db.create_all()` method to create the tables.

3. **ProgrammingError: (sqlite3.ProgrammingError) SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread**: I realized that I was accessing the database from multiple threads. To fix this, I made sure to use the Flask application context when accessing the database.

By addressing these errors, I was able to successfully load, create, and build the database in my Flask application.
