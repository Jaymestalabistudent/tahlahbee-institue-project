# Understanding the Backend Branching Strategy

In backend development, it's important to have a structured branching strategy to manage code efficiently and ensure a smooth deployment process. Let's dive into the three key branches in our workflow: **Core**, **Development**, and **Deployment**. Each branch has a specific role in the development lifecycle, helping to keep the project stable, secure, and ready for production.

## **Branch Overview**

### **1. Core Branch**

**Purpose:**
- The **Core** branch is the foundation of the project. It contains the base code and essential workarounds needed for the application to function. This branch includes foundational features and critical fixes that ensure the core functionality of the application.

**Characteristics:**
- **Base Code:** Contains the fundamental codebase of the application.
- **Workarounds:** Includes necessary workarounds or hacks required to maintain functionality and address immediate issues.
- **Stability:** While it's the base, it may not be the most stable branch. It's the starting point for further development and testing.

**Use Case:**
- The Core branch is used for foundational development and applying necessary quick fixes. It serves as the baseline from which other branches are created. The code here may be more experimental and less refined compared to the Production-ready branch.

### **2. Development Branch**

**Purpose:**
- The **Development** branch serves as the pre-production environment. It's used to integrate and test new features, improvements, and bug fixes before they are considered stable and ready for production. This branch allows for thorough testing and validation of code changes.

**Characteristics:**
- **Testing Ground:** Provides a staging area for testing new features and changes.
- **Integration:** Integrates changes from the Core branch and other feature branches.
- **Pre-Production:** Represents the code that has been tested but is not yet production-ready. It serves as a middle ground where code is prepared for final production.

**Use Case:**
- Code from the Core branch is merged into Development for further testing and integration. This branch allows developers to test features in a near-production environment and ensures that all changes work well together before moving to the final Production branch.

### **3. Deployment Branch**

**Purpose:**
- The **Deployment** branch is the final, production-ready branch. It contains code that has been thoroughly tested and is considered ready for release. The Deployment branch has a cleaned-up commit history and is prepared to be pushed to the production environment.

**Characteristics:**
- **Production-Ready:** Includes thoroughly tested code that is ready for deployment.
- **Clean History:** Features a streamlined commit history with unnecessary or experimental changes removed.
- **Final Validation:** Represents the code that has passed all pre-production tests and is ready to be deployed to the live environment.

**Use Case:**
- The Deployment branch is used to prepare code for production. It's the branch from which the final release is made. Code is merged here from the Development branch after thorough testing and validation. This branch ensures that only stable, production-ready code is deployed.

## **Branch Workflow**

1. **Core Branch Development:**
    - Start with the Core branch for fundamental development. Apply base code and necessary workarounds to ensure the application's core functionality.

2. **Feature Development in Core Branch:**
    - Develop and test features in the Core branch. Once features are developed, they are tested locally or in an isolated environment.

3. **Testing and Integration in Development Branch:**
    - Merge code from the Core branch into the Development branch. Perform integration testing and refine features in this branch. Address any issues and validate that all changes work as expected.

4. **Preparing for Production:**
    - Once the code in the Development branch is stable and tested, merge it into the Deployment branch. Clean up the commit history and make any final adjustments needed for production.

5. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy code from the Deployment branch to the production environment. Ensure that the deployment is smooth and that the production environment is stable.

## **Branching Summary**

- **Core Branch:** The base branch with foundational code and workarounds. Used for initial development and essential fixes.
- **Development Branch:** The pre-production branch where code is tested and integrated. Serves as the staging environment before final production.
- **Deployment Branch:** The production-ready branch with a cleaned-up commit history. Contains thoroughly tested code ready for release.

By following this branching strategy, you can effectively manage your codebase, ensure stability, and streamline the deployment process. Each branch serves a specific purpose in the development lifecycle, helping to maintain a clear and organized workflow.
