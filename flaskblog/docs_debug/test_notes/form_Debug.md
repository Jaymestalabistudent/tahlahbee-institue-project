# forms
Image Handling (save_picture function):
## Generate Unique Filename
A random hexadecimal string is created to ensure that each uploaded image has a unique filename. This prevents overwriting of existing files and avoids filename collisions.

## Determine File Extension
The file extension of the uploaded image is extracted to maintain the original file type (e.g., .jpg, .png).

## Save Resized Image
The image is resized to a thumbnail of 125x125 pixels using the PIL library (Python Imaging Library). The resized image is then saved in the static/img/profile_pics directory.

## Return Filename
The function returns the filename of the saved image for reference in updating the user’s profile.

```python
def save_picture(form_picture):
    # Generate a random hex string for the filename
    random_hex = secrets.token_hex(8)
    # Get the file extension
    _, f_ext = os.path.splitext(form_picture.filename)
    # Combine to create a new filename
    picture_fn = random_hex + f_ext
    # Define the path to save the picture
    picture_path = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static/img/profile_pics', picture_fn)

    # Resize the image
    output_size = (125, 125)
    i = Image.open(form_picture)
    i.thumbnail(output_size)
    i.save(picture_path)

    return picture_fn
```

## Profile Update Route (/account)
### Form Handling
Handles both GET and POST requests to manage profile updates. When the form is submitted, it validates the data and updates the user’s profile information.

### Profile Picture Update
If a new profile picture is uploaded, it is processed and saved using the `save_picture` function. The user’s profile picture field (`current_user.image_file`) is updated with the new filename.

### User Information Update
Updates the username and email based on the form input. It then commits the changes to the database.

### Error Handling
Rolls back the database session if an error occurs during the commit and logs the error for debugging purposes.

### Form Population
On GET requests, pre-fills the form with the current user’s existing username and email.

### Image URL Retrieval
Constructs the URL for the user’s profile image to be used in the profile page.

```python
@app.route("/account", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def account():
    form = UpdateAccountForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        # Check if the user has uploaded a new profile picture
        if form.picture.data:
            picture_file = save_picture(form.picture.data)
            current_user.image_file = picture_file

        # Update user information
        current_user.username = form.username.data
        current_user.email = form.email.data
        try:
            db.session.commit()
            flash('Your account has been updated!', 'success')

            # Optional: Send email or perform other actions here

            return redirect(url_for('account'))
        except Exception as e:
            db.session.rollback()  # Rollback in case of error
            flash('An error occurred while updating your account.', 'danger')
            app.logger.error(f"Error during commit: {e}")

    elif request.method == 'GET':
        # Populate the form with current user data
        form.username.data = current_user.username
        form.email.data = current_user.email

    # Retrieve the URL for the profile image
    image_file = url_for('static', filename='img/profile_pics/' + current_user.image_file)

    return render_template('account.html', title='Account',
                           image_file=image_file, form=form)
```

## Form Validation (UpdateAccountForm)
### Username Validation
Ensures that the new username is unique by checking the database for existing users with the same username. Raises a validation error if a match is found.

### Email Validation
Ensures that the new email address is unique by checking the database for existing users with the same email address. Raises a validation error if a match is found.

```python
class UpdateAccountForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField('Username',
                           validators=[DataRequired(), Length(min=2, max=20)])
    email = StringField('Email',
                        validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    picture = FileField('Image', validators=[FileRequired(), FileAllowed(['jpg', 'png'])])
    submit = SubmitField('Update')

    def validate_username(self, username):
        if username.data != current_user.username:
            user = User.query.filter_by(username=username.data).first()
            if user:
                raise ValidationError('That username is taken. Please choose a different one.')

    def validate_email(self, email):
        if email.data != current_user.email:
            user = User.query.filter_by(email=email.data).first()
            if user:
                raise ValidationError('That email is taken. Please choose a different one.')
```

## Debug completed and ensured:
- Image uploads and resizing work correctly by testing with various image formats and sizes.
- User profile updates (username and email) reflect correctly in the database.
- Handle scenarios where the same username or email is used by another user.
