In my Flask application, I encountered a `NameError` stating that the name 'app' is not defined. This error occurred in the file `run.py` at line 1. 

To fix this error, I needed to ensure that the 'app' variable is properly defined. After reviewing my code, I realized that I forgot to import the 'app' variable from the `flaskblog` module in the `__init__.py` file.

To resolve the issue, I added the following import statement at the top of the `__init__.py` file:

```python
from flaskblog import app
```

By importing the 'app' variable, I made it accessible in the `run.py` file, thus resolving the `NameError` issue.

After making this fix, the Flask application should run without any further errors.

The error message indicates that the 'app' variable is not defined in the `__init__.py` file. To fix this, you can add the import statement mentioned above.
