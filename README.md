# Tahlahbee Institute Blog - Core Python Application

## Overview

This repository contains the core Python application for the Tahlahbee Institute blog. Please use Deployment branch or Development Branch for your deployment and testing needs. The Core Branch serves as the foundational framework for the blog site, providing essential functionality and basic routes to structure the application.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project was to establish the basic structure and functionality of the Tahlahbee Institute blog. It includes the core components necessary for a Python web application, such as route handling, form processing, and basic template rendering.

### Current State

Please note that this BRANCH is currently in a **stale-but-usable-for-local-learning** state. While it provides the essential building blocks, it lacks the dynamic features and content that would be required for a fully functional blog. Including app file structure. 

### Features

- **Basic Routes:** The application includes minimal route definitions that handle the core functionalities, such as rendering templates and processing forms.
- **Template Structure:** The project utilizes basic Jinja2 templates to render HTML pages, forming the backbone of the blog's front-end.
- **Form Handling:** Includes simple form processing logic, which could be extended for user input, blog submissions, etc.

### Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tahlahbee-institue-project.git
   ```
   
2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Future Development

While this project is currently in a stale state, it can be expanded upon in the future. The framework is in place to build a more dynamic and feature-rich blog application by adding more complex routes, database integration, user authentication, and other advanced features.

### Conclusion

This repository represents the groundwork for the Tahlahbee Institute blog. It provides a starting point for further development but should be considered a foundational framework rather than a complete solution. Future enhancements can be made to fully realize the potential of the blog application.
